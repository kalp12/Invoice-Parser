The Central bank of the UAE (CBUAE) uses macroprudential instruments to ensure and promote financial stability in the UAE. To reduce the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities, the CBUAE introduced regulations regarding mortgage loans in $2013^{17}$. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, CBUAE relaxed its Loan-to Value ratio by 5\% for first house/owner occupied buyers. The intervention means that maximum loan to value ratios stand as follows:

TABLE 1.4.1: MAXIMUM LOAN TO VALUE SCHEDULE

|  | UAE National | Expatriates |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| First house/owner occupier |  |  |
| Value equal or less <br> than AED 5 million | $85 \%$ | $80 \%$ |
| Value equal or greater <br> than AED 5 million | $75 \%$ | $70 \%$ |
| Second House/ Investment <br> property | $65 \%$ | $60 \%$ |
| Off-plan | $50 \%$ | $50 \%$ |

In addition, the CBUAE will revise the existing limit which sets maximum exposure that banks can have to the real estate sector.

The profitability of the sector as a whole remained healthy, mainly driven by strong earnings registered by Emaar Group and Aldar Properties with a slight uptick during 2019 measured by positive Return On Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). However, the number of loss-generating corporates among the sample companies have also continued to increase.
